# AWS Rekognition API demo

Demo of the Rekognition service from AWS. Uses the version 2 API - most
examples I found online - including the AWS docs - use version 1 which 
was quite different.

To run the sample, you will need to get some AWS credentials. Create a file
at ~/.aws/credentials:

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <your access key>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your secret access key>
